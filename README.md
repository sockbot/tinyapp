## How it works

A user with an account can create and edit short URLs that redirect to other URLs on the internet.

Users are able to store the shortened URLs in their library. Only the owner of a URL library can view their library, but each shortened URL can be shared publicly.

User passwords are salted and hashed using bcrypt. Encrypted cookies are set on the browser client in order to have login persistence between views.

## Getting Started

- Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command).
